# Khan-Shaheed-Pashto-Font-by-Dr-Sarwar
This font and keyboard layout are developed for the Pashto language and include five additional letters originally proposed and published by Khan Shaheed in 1956: ٵ ڌ ۅ ۄ ݺ and diacritic marks: ّ      ٘    ْ        This is the first complete implementation of these letters and marks in both Font and Keyboard for Windows.
